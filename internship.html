                    In September of 2021 I started an internship at <a href="https://www.indexwebmarketing.com/en/"></a>Index Web Marketing</a>. Index mostly focus' on marketing campaigns, but they have spent the last couple of years developing Alya. Alya is thier propietary artifical intellegence algorithm that can make predictions and suggestions to increase returns on marketing campains.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the first tasks assigned to me was to take the predictions that Alya had made about the location and interest of a potential customer, and populate some drop-down menus on the client's homepage. We ran an experiment with having around 70% of website visitors being shown the populated downs, and the other 30 just seeing the standard "select region" as the default selected. The experimental group saw a +60% increase in conversions. The experiment was a great success and marked the first time that Index put Alya out in the real world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another big project that was going on when I arrived was preparing to launch Alya as a SaaS product. Most of the groundwork was completed but I helped implement a lot of front-end features and fix some bugs that had yet to be addressed. I also added Google Tag Manager to the site, and a couple of other clients as well in order to improve thier Google Ads campaigns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was a very challenging, but rewarding internship. I did work that clients actually saw instead of just pushing some papers for an internship. They liked me at Index, I ended up staying for 8 months instead of the original 6 months. They wanted to keep me for longer but I do not want to make a career in marketing company. I left Index in May of 2022 so that I could focus on completing my degree program and look for a career that is a better fit for me.
